                Republic Act 7889, An Act Creating the University of the Philippines in
                Mindanao, was signed into law by President Fidel V. Ramos on February 20, 1995.
                But the vision of having a UP in Mindanao however started way before that.
            <br><br>
                The UP Alumni Association-Davao Chapter, which was established on December 3,
                1949, had wanted for more than two decades for the establishment of a UP in
                Mindanao. As early as 1961, the UP Summer School already offered extension
                courses in Law, Business Administration and Education, with the old location of
                the Davao Central Elementary School as venue.
            <br><br>
                On November 24 and 25, 1989, the UPAA Davao Chapter hosted the 12th UP Alumni
                Institute with Senator Vicente Paterno as keynote speaker. UP President Jose
                Abueva, who attended the conference, was confronted with the strong and united
                voice of about 630 alumni in attendance as well as the media and the business
                sector, all clamoring for a resolution that would promote the establishment of a
                UP in Mindanao in Davao City. The resolution was unanimously approved and
                adopted by the Institute on November 25, 1989. This was submitted to the UPAA
                National and endorsed to the Board of Regents.
            <br><br>
                The vision of UP in Mindanao began to materialize when, on the third regular
                session of the House of Representatives on April 30, 1990, 1st District
                Representative Prospero C. Nograles introduced House Bill No. 30358, also known
                as an “Act to establish the University of the Philippines in Mindanao.”
            <br><br>
                A public hearing on HB No. 30358 was conducted by Senator
                Edgardo Angara (then Chairman of the Senate Committee on
                Education) on October 12, 1990 at the Davao Chamber of Commerce,
                Kalakalan Hall. It was sponsored by Representative Nograles and
                Rodolfo del Rosario of Davao del Norte. A strong sentiment for
                the establishment of a UP in Mindanao pervaded the public
                hearing. To alleviate the strong clamor for a UP in Mindanao,
                Abueva created instead the UP Consortium System, much like the
                Open University.
            <br><br>
                When Abueva’s term ended, President Fidel V. Ramos appointed
                Emil Q. Javier as UP President. President Ramos had previously
                instructed President Javier to create a fact-finding committee
                composed of Regents Oscar Alfonso, Vice-President for Planning
                Fortunato dela Peña, Atty. Carmelita Yadao-Guno and Prof.
                Rogelio Cuyno. The committee came to Davao for an ocular
                inspection of University of Southern Philippines (USP) in Bago
                Oshiro.
            <br><br>
                After receiving the committee report, Javier did not pursue the
                plan to convert USP to UP in Mindanao due to the resistance
                demonstrated by the USP faculty and staff. Instead, he opted for
                congressional action. At the same time, the committee also
                talked with the National Bureau of Plant and Industry director
                Nerios Roperos for the segregation of 204 hectares of the BPI
                area in Bago Oshiro for the UP in Mindanao campus. The task of
                pursuing the House Bill for UP in Mindanao in Congress was given
                to Davao City 3rd District Congressman Elias B. Lopez, as he was
                the only UP alumnus among the Davao representatives.
            <br><br>
                Republic Act 7889, the bill creating UP in Mindanao was finally
                enacted into law on February 20, 1995. On March 22 of the same
                year, the Board of Regents passed a resolution officially
                creating the University of the Philippines in Mindanao. To
                emphasize the importance of RA 7889 to the Mindanaoans, a
                reenactment of the signing was held at the Central Bank, Davao
                City with President Fidel V. Ramos himself in attendance.
            <br><br>
                The Lee Business Center in J. Luna corner J. dela Cruz Streets
                and the Casa Mercado Building in Matina served as UP in
                Mindanao’s home from March to September 1995, and from September
                to January 1996, respectively.
            <br><br>
                On June 1996, the College of Arts and Sciences and the School of
                Management were created. After a year, the CAS was split into
                the College of Humanities and Social Sciences and the College of
                Science and Mathematics. The School of Management was retained.
            <br><br>
                On February 20, the Oblation was installed in Bago Oshiro during
                the University’s 3rd Foundation Anniversary. The Board of
                Regents granted full autonomy to UP in Mindanao, on February 26,
                1998, making it the sixth constituent unit of the UP System.
                Dean Rogelio V. Cuyno, was elevated and installed as its 1st
                Chancellor on December 11, of the same year.
            <br><br>
                The 2nd Chancellor was Ricardo de Ungria, the 3rd Chancellor was
                Gilda C. Rivero, and the 4th Chancellor is Sylvia B. Concepcion.
                The 5th Chancellor is Larry N. Digal (term: March 2019-February
                2021).
