        <div>
            The Department of Biological Sciences and Environmental Studies (BSES) offers a 4-year BS Biology degree program with two major fields of specialization to choose from, Ecology and Cell Biology. Areas of study in Ecology include life forms in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. The Cell Biology division has recently been expanded to include not only studies of life forms at cellular level, but also molecular studies of plant, animal and microbial life forms.

            The BS Biology curriculum also includes the conduct of an undergraduate thesis which provides the students the opportunity to perform research work along their chosen field of specialization under the guidance of their selected faculty adviser.

            JOB OPPORTUNITIES

            Students may proceed to pursue a medical degree after graduation. Other graduates may pursue careers in either government and private institutions as teachers or researchers, or in government organizations engaged in biological conservation and/or advocacy activities.
